Hydrophilic Small Molecules That Harness Transthyretin To Enhance
the Safety and Efficacy of Targeted Chemotherapeutic Agents
INTRODUCTION
Most chemotherapeutic agents are designed to interfere with
processes inside a tumor cell. These cytotoxic drugs should be
hydrophobic enough to diffuse across cell membranes and
reach their intracellular targets. However, the hydrophobicity
of these drugs will usually result in their nonselective passive
distribution into healthy cells and organs resulting in collateral
toxicity. Therefore, strategies that minimize the toxicity of
these cytotoxic agents toward healthy cells while maintaining
their potency on tumor cells are highly desirable. One
attractive strategy for achieving the required therapeutic
potency with minimal toxicity is through targeted cancer
therapy.1 Antibody−drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a
promising approach for cancer therapy that involves
conjugation of the cytotoxic agent to antibodies targeted to
specific tumor antigens. While the large size of ADCs (size
∼150 kDa) limits the nonselective distribution of the cytotoxic
agent into healthy cells and tissues, it also reduces their rate of
diffusion and extent of penetration into solid tumor tissues.
Therefore, the majority of approved ADCs and the ones in
